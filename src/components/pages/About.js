      <h3>
      Hello, my name is Oscar Salgado Roman! I am 27 (as of this current date). born on October 5th, 1994. I was born in Mexico but raised in Georgia. I have lived in Georgia for the past 25 years so I call the south my home. I am an up and coming new Full-stack web developer! I have been in the food industry for a very big portion of my working years. Before getting into Web development I was a Bartender and enjoyed it very much, but always had the desire to get into the world of computer science and web development. So I started my new career path by taking a coding boot camp provided by Georgia Tech! GO BEE'S!!!! Going from a bartender to a Web dev has not been the easiest transition, but with enough determination and hours of studying, I am very confident that I will get to where I need to be. I have so much to learn and so much I wanna accomplish. I am very excited about where my new career path in web development will take me!
